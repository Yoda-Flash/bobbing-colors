# bobbing-colors
A cathartic CSS Animation of colors bobbing around. Made with pure HTML and CSS!

I wanted to try my hand at making CSS Animations, and thought it would be relaxing to watch blobs of different colors bobbing around on a web page. I chose my favorite color combinations when creating the blobs, and gained inspiration for the glow, gradient radial background, and gradient radial blobs from studying the examples on the Cascade YSWS website.
